💡Inspiration💡
Nigeria's economy in recent years have suffered lot of backsliding, and theft of financial documents and resources became a major concern for the country. You oven heald when people stole ATM card and steal the owners property. Fraud calls asking people to call out their card numbers. Most people especially those that are not aware do fall victim of this fraudulent activities. As a way of mitigating and also eliminating this, an idea of having an environment where people do not need card to perform basic financial transactions. Since biometrics data such as facial recognition can't be stolen, if we can make use of this in fintech, much problem will be solved. Not only will theft and fraud be reduced but also provides the ability to perform transactions every, we carry our face with us all the time.

❓What it does❓
It's an hardware that simulate an Automated Teller Machine but accepts pin code and facial recognition. It processes all user transactions and send notifications via SMS.

🏗️How we built it🏗️
It's an hardware fintech project so Raspberry pi 4 was used as the main Computer integrated with a Camera module, the interface is presented to the user via a Web portal where they an enter their Account name and PIN Code after which facial verification will run to certify the user. After all transactions, Twillio API will be used in sending SMS to the user.

🚧Challenges we ran into🚧
The first challenge was setting up facial recognition on the Raspberry pi especially being a small computer. While trying to run openCV on the Raspberry pi. This challenge was later overcame.

It's not easy working remotely as a team especially for an hardware project such as this, this was another challenge we ran into but the tasks were accordingly distributed so all team members will have a take.

It's not a major challenge buy due to the world shortage of chips, getting the camera module came with some challenges but it was later purchased to be used in the project.

🏅🏆ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE PROUD OF🏅🏆
Building a solution such as Facial recognition transaction in Nigeria is a thing we're proud of. Being able to achieve working remotely even in an hardware project. It feels good achieving a system that consists of PIN code, Facial recognition and also SMS services for finance transactions is what can bring about a new era in country's economy.

📚🙋‍♂️What we learned📚🙋‍♂️
The greatest achievement in this project is what was learnt while building it, the hardware engineer for example haven't work with twillio or any Web applications before but in a limited time had to learn how to integrate all these into the hardware.

⏱⌛⏳🏃‍♂️Time Management⏱⌛⏳🏃‍♂️
We had a tough time managing time this weekend with our participation in this Hackathon as we had to work on multiple things altogether. We lost alot of hackathon time in brainstorming and team building yet we are proud that things went according to our plans. Fortunately, we could do this by distributing our work and focusing on multitasking. Extremely excited for all the learnings and teachings we had got through this hack.

💭What's next for ProTransK💭
Working on the Web portal to give more transaction options to the user
